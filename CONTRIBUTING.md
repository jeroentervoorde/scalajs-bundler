## General recommendations

Test and document each added feature.

## Organization of the repository

- `sbt-scalajs-bundler/` The scalajs-bundler sbt plugin
- `sbt-web-scalajs-bundler/` sbt plugin for integrating scalajs-bundler and
[sbt-web-scalajs](https://github.com/vmunier/sbt-web-scalajs)
- `manual/` Sources of the documentation

## Build the project

~~~ sh
$ sbt package
~~~

## Run the tests

We use [sbt-scripted](http://eed3si9n.com/testing-sbt-plugins) to test the plugins. However, we customized
the way tests are launched to filter tests according to their compatibility with major versions of sbt and Scala.js:

- tests can have a `project/build.properties` file defining a specific sbt version they are compatible with,
- test names suffixed with `_sjs-0.6` are only compatible with Scala.js 0.6.

The version of Scala.js to use is provided by the `SCALAJS_VERSION` environment variable. You can set the sbt version
to use with the standard `^^` operator.

To run all the tests:

~~~ sh
$ sbt runScripted
~~~

Or, with a specific sbt version:

~~~ bash
$ sbt ^^1.2.8 runScripted
~~~

Or, with a specific Scala.js version (Scala.js 1.x also requires sbt 1.x):

~~~ bash
$ SCALAJS_VERSION=1.0.0 sbt ^^1.2.8 runScripted
~~~

To run a single test:

~~~ sh
$ sbt "sbt-scalajs-bundler/scripted sbt-scalajs-bundler/<test-name>"
~~~

(where `<test-name>` is replaced by one of the
[tests](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalajs-bundler/tree/master/sbt-scalajs-bundler/src/sbt-test/sbt-scalajs-bundler)).

Sometimes you would like to open an interactive sbt shell and manually play with
sbt tasks instead of writing them into a sbt-scripted test. In such a case, you
can start with an existing sbt-scripted test and add the following commands at
the top of its `test` file:

~~~
$ pause
$ fail
~~~

Then, when you will run the scripted task on this this test, it will start by
making a pause. You can then open a new sbt shell in the running test:

~~~
$ cd /tmp/sbt_fa1e13d43/test-name
$ sbt -Dplugin.version=x.y.z-SNAPSHOT
~~~

(where `x.y.z` is replaced by the current version of sbt-scalajs-bundler)

## Publish locally

~~~ sh
$ sbt publishLocal
~~~

## Preview the documentation

~~~ sh
$ sbt manual/previewSite
~~~

## Publish a release

- Check that the `changelog.md` file is up to date (in the `manual` project)
- Push a Git tag (name it `vX.Y.Z`, where `X`, `Y`, `Z` are major, minor and revision numbers, respectively)
  - Either from GitHub [web interface](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalajs-bundler/releases/new),
  - Or from the Git CLI: `$ git tag v1.0.0; git push --tags`
